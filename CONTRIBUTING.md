# Contribution to SQL Server Simulator

## Bugs & Feature Requests

- Issues for bugs and feature requests are welcome, but please check for an existing issue first.
- Include an example of the desired outcome.

## Contributing Code

- You must be the legal owner of your code and you must be willing to surrender it to this project's license.
- Code additions and changes should be the _absolute minimum required_ to achieve your goal.
- Formatting or style changes may only be combined with bug fixes or new features, and can only reformat the modified area.
- Introducing a new 3rd party dependency is not permitted.

If you make a PR that is rejected for any reason, but still has useful qualities, those changes might be extracted and integrated anyway.
To avoid this and ensure repository history associates your contributions to _you_, make sure your PR is in an acceptable state so it can be directly merged as-is.
